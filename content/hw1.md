# Homework 1

1. Read the Wikipeida entry on 
[bias-variance tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff).

1. Read the plots in the [second last slide frame](/slides/w1c-intro-stat-learning.pdf).
   
   Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in the three cases in your own words.

   The three plots use the same data generation processes as the previous three examples. During the lecture, I have explained the MSE-flexibility curves from the perspective of overfitting. Here I want to see your explanations from the perspective of
   bias-variance tradeoff.
