# Syllabus

**Update on Nov 29:**
There will be 

- five homeworks (each worth 10 pts), `X`; 
- a take-home final exam (50 pts), `Y`;
- a final in-class presentation (50 pts), `Z`.

Your final grade will be `max{X, Y} + Z`.
In other words, if you finish all five homeworks
and get full marks, you can safely skip the final exam.
You should submit your homeworks to my email:
hlei AT hnu dot edu dot cn.

Dear students,

Welcome to the course on labor economics!
I am very happy (and excited) to teach this course to you---graduate students
with diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds---and 
I will take that advantage to 
make this course better.

## Grades

As you all know, this is a course on labor economics.
I am 99% confident that you must know 
the domestic labor markets of your country 
better than me. So, this course will end with a **Term Project**,
which will be a (perhaps collective) 
effort to study an important aspect of the labor markets of your country.
Specifically, you will research some particular topic
on the labor markets of your country
and will give an in-class presentation to show your work.
Half of your final grades will depend on your performance on the Term Project.
Another half of final grades will depend on a **Take-Home Exam**.

## About this course

Labor economics is a fascinating and constantly evolving field.
Today it has gone far beyond the mere study of labor markets.
Some hot topics of modern labor economics include
inequality, human capital, return on education, immigration, etc.
Economists (we) are also
digging into the root of labor-market related problems from various perspectives: macro, micro, international, development, urban...


In this course, I will focus on the empirical side of labor economics as
modern labor research is heavily empirical.
The major benefit of my peculiar teaching strategy is that you will get an impression of what frontier research is about.
Having said that, I will (try to) make the lectures accessible even to an undergraduate who has only taken introductory microeconomics. 
So do not panic!
You can learn a lot from this course even if you have no exposure to
econometrics or R before.

## Bonus and class participation

While this is an online course,
I do wish to have more interactions with you.
Specifically, I encourage you to ask questions in class. As an economist, I believe that people respond to incentives---so
**each good question will bring an extra 0.5 bonus point to your final grade**.
To prevent possible abuse of this policy, an individual student can get at most 2 extra points through this bonus policy.

It's up to me
whether a question is good or not. However, like what all good teachers would say, "these is no bad question." Any question that is 
(even tangentially) related to the course materials will be considered good, and the student/asker will get an extra 0.5 point as per the policy above.

That's it. Looking forward to seeing you in class.
